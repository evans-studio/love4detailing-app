LOVE 4 DETAILING APP DEVELOPMENT SCRIPT

This document is the definitive project implementation plan. It outlines the technical standards, structure, and expectations for the full development of the Love 4 Detailing platform. This file must be referenced throughout the build process to maintain alignment with the project vision, ensure clean and scalable code, and preserve consistent UI/UX across all environments.

⸻

1. OBJECTIVE

Deliver a fully functional, responsive, and modern booking web app for Love 4 Detailing. The platform should:
	•	Offer a seamless UX from QR scan/landing to completed booking.
	•	Use GSAP motion effects throughout (subtle and on-brand).
	•	Ensure all features (booking, account, uploads, email flows) are working.
	•	Maintain clean, modular, and DRY code principles.
	•	Leverage Supabase for database, auth, and media storage.
	•	Be scalable and easily updatable post-launch.

2. STRUCTURE & ARCHITECTURE

Folder Structure

/public
  |- assets
  |- scripts
  |- prompts
/src
  |- components
  |- pages
  |- layouts
  |- lib
  |- styles
  |- hooks
  |- utils

	•	All visual assets must be compressed SVG or WebP.
	•	Maintain reusable component logic (cards, forms, modals, buttons).
	•	Centralize config and shared styles.
	•	Utility functions and Supabase logic should be isolated.

Git Commit & Push Standards

To maintain clean version control, predictable deployment, and stable development, follow these source control practices:

When to Push
	•	Feature Completion
Push when a functional feature or UI component is completed and does not break the app.
	•	Logical Milestones
Examples: Dashboard section finished, GSAP animation added, Supabase logic complete, responsive layout in place.
	•	Pre-Refactor Safety Save
Before rewriting or deleting sections of code, push the current working version to preserve history.
	•	End-of-Session Backup
Always push stable code before ending a development session or switching tasks.

When Not to Push
	•	Code that is broken, incomplete, or not functional.
	•	Work-in-progress that disrupts existing functionality unless it's in a separate dev branch.
	•	Messy or unstructured experiments without notes or cleanup.

 Commit Message Format

Use clear and structured commit messages in lowercase with tags:

feat: add customer booking flow
fix: correct mobile nav layout bug
refactor: clean up animation sequence
style: update service card UI
chore: remove unused console logs

Recommended Commit Frequency
	•	Push every 30–90 minutes or after 100–300 lines of clean, functional code.
	•	Push smaller chunks if completing isolated updates or UI changes.
	•	Push more frequently during high-build stages like dashboard, database logic, GSAP, or responsiveness tweaks.

Design Consistency Requirements (App-Wide)

All interface elements — including sidebars, dashboards, buttons, cards, and landing sections — must adhere to a unified visual system.

Global UI Standards:
	•	Primary Brand Colour: Use #A64AFB (or latest approved purple) as the dominant accent across all pages — including dashboard UI, sidebars, buttons, form highlights, and headings.
	•	Typography: Maintain the same font family, sizes, weights, and spacing rules from the landing page across dashboard and app screens.
	•	Shadows, Radii & Borders: All containers, cards, buttons, and modals must use the same radius values, box shadows, and border styling throughout.
	•	Button Styles: Primary, secondary, and outline buttons must retain identical padding, hover states, animations (GSAP), and color rules across all views — landing and dashboard.
	•	Sidebar Styling: The sidebar must:
	•	Use the same purple gradient or solid fill as the hero/CTA elements.
	•	Include hover/active states consistent with landing page buttons.
	•	Display icons and text styled in line with the design system.

Design Checks Per Commit:

Before committing visual changes:
	•	Run a full app pass (landing, dashboard, and sidebar).
	•	Ensure all updated styles match the core theme variables (defined in /styles/theme.ts or global CSS).
	•	Visually inspect the sidebar and dashboard interactions — especially buttons and links — for design fidelity and functional consistency.
	•	Confirm GSAP animations remain smooth and do not clash with content hierarchy or legibility.

If it doesn't match the visual tone and UX of the landing page, it doesn't go in.

Workspace and Terminal Discipline

To avoid performance issues, confusion, and broken development flows:
	•	Always keep only one terminal session active at a time unless explicitly debugging a concurrent process. 
	•	Close unused terminals to reduce memory load and prevent accidental conflicts (such as duplicate builds or multiple ports).
	•	Keep your editor or file tabs minimal — close irrelevant files once you're done working on them.
	•	Name open terminals clearly (e.g., dev-server, supabase, storybook) when multiple are temporarily needed.

Streamlined workspace = faster builds, fewer mistakes, and cleaner code.

MAINTAIN CODE QUALITY AT ALL TIMES. DO NOT RUSH, DO NOT DUPLICATE.
Every line of code must contribute toward a thoughtful, clean, and scalable app.
