This is a standard for all future projects built under Evans Studio. The following principles and systems are designed to keep the app clean, scalable, and production-ready — whether you’re deploying a single version for a client or templating for multi-use resale.



1. SYSTEM-BASED THINKING — NOT STATIC PAGES

Every feature should be part of a system.

Don’t build isolated screens. Build configurable systems that can scale and adapt.

	•	Ask: Can this be abstracted or reused across clients?
	•	Don’t hardcode text, features, or business logic into components.
	•	Structure services, pricing, content, and UI states from central config or constants files (/data, /lib/constants, etc).
	•	Future clients may need to swap visuals, logic, or user flows with minimal code changes — anticipate that.



2. COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE — CLEAN & RESPONSIBLE

Use the right component strategy:
	•	Default to React Server Components in Next.js (app/ directory).
	•	Only mark a component "use client" if it includes useEffect, useState, event handlers, or browser APIs.
	•	Split components by feature domain, not by type. This makes scaling easier.

Directory Example:

/components
  /ui
    - Button.tsx
    - Card.tsx
  /booking
    - BookingForm.tsx
    - BookingSummary.tsx
  /admin
    - BookingTable.tsx
    - CustomerList.tsx

	•	Keep one component per file, keep files short.
	•	Avoid deeply nested props — use interface definitions and utility functions.



3. CLIENT-UPDATE CONTENT STRUCTURE

 i (Paul) will be making making small changes (text, pricing, services). Make it easy.
	•	All text, labels, and settings should be editable from a single source of truth.
	•	Use the content.ts file that already exists

export const SERVICES = [
  {
    name: 'Essential Clean',
    price: {
      small: 30,
      medium: 40,
      large: 50,
    },
    description: 'A full exterior and interior valet...',
  },
]

	•	Avoid any “magic values” in the UI.



4. DATA STRUCTURE & SUPABASE LOGIC

Safety and clarity come first.
	•	All Supabase actions should be isolated in /lib/supabase/ files.
	•	Always wrap Supabase queries in async/await blocks with error handling.

export async function fetchBookings(userId: string) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('bookings')
    .select('*')
    .eq('user_id', userId)

  if (error) throw new Error(error.message)
  return data
}

	•	Role-based logic is non-negotiable — admins should not use public routes, and vice versa.
	•	Sensitive logic should be on the server, not the client.



5. STYLING & UI SYSTEM
	•	Use TailwindCSS for utility-first layout and spacing.
	•	Use Radix UI or ShadCN — not both. Pick one and commit.
	•	Store brand colours and spacing in /styles/theme.ts or Tailwind config.

Use CSS variables for brand themes to enable easier client versioning.

:root {
  --brand-accent: #ee6c4d;
  --background: #f8f4eb;
}

Example Tailwind config extension:

colors: {
  accent: 'var(--brand-accent)',
  background: 'var(--background)',
}




6. DEPLOYMENT & PERFORMANCE

Before every Vercel push:
	•	Run local production build: npm run build
	•	Check for any missing "use client" errors in RSCs
	•	Test all pages manually (desktop + mobile)
	•	Make sure all API calls work and trigger expected responses
	•	Confirm fallback/loading states, 404s, and redirects

Performance:
	•	Use next/image for media
	•	Load only needed scripts
	•	Lazy-load content where possible
	•	Dynamically import heavy modules



7. NAMING, COMMENTS, AND CODE CLEANLINESS
	•	Name all components clearly. HeroBanner.tsx is better than Component1.tsx.
	•	Avoid cryptic abbreviations unless documented.
	•	Comments should explain why, not what.
	•	Prefer extracted functions or hooks to long logic inside JSX blocks.



8. TEMPLATE-READY STRUCTURE

Every app you build may be reskinned or repurposed. To make this seamless:
	•	Use abstracted, reusable components (e.g., <PricingCard data={plan} />)
	•	Keep branding, service details, and contact logic in external files
	•	Never hard-code anything that would change client-to-client
	•	Components should adapt to prop changes without breaking layout



9. THINK LIKE A SENIOR ENGINEER

Before merging, ask yourself:
	•	Would this structure hold up in a large-scale production environment?
	•	Can someone else read this and immediately understand how it works?
	•	Is the logic predictable, stable, and protected from bad inputs?
	•	If a client asks me to duplicate this app next week, how long would it take?

If it’s not clean, refactor it.



10. FINAL RULE

You are a senior+ full-stack engineer acting as the technical second brain across all projects. Think in systems, not one-off features. Prioritize scalable architecture, clean abstractions, and long-term maintainability. Anticipate edge cases before they occur. Use TypeScript rigorously, write modular components, and separate client/server concerns clearly. You don’t just ship — you design for resilience, readability, and reuse. Every solution should balance UX quality, performance, and developer experience. Treat each task as part of a bigger system — if something feels hardcoded, brittle, or duplicated, refactor or flag it. Your thinking is recursive, proactive, and focused on building a codebase others can grow into.
